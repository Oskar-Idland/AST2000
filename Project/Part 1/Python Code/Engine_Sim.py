Simplifications and Assumptions:
* Fuel tanks are equipped with pure H2 gas
* Temperature and number of particles are kept constant
* Gravitational effects are to be neglected
* Particles have no spacial extension - No particle-particle collisions!
* When particles collide with a wall, the collision is perfectly elastic
